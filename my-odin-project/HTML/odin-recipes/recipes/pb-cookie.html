        <h2>Easy Peanut Butter Cookies</h2>
        <p>It couldn't be simpler to make this easy peanut butter cookie recipe (you can even memorize it and make it without looking at the recipe!). Here are the three ingredients you'll need:</p>
        <br>
        <h2>Ingredients:</h2>
        <ul>
            <br><li><strong>Peanut butter:</strong> This recipe starts with one cup of peanut butter. For these cookies, commercial peanut butter (like Jif or Peter Pan) works better than natural brands.</li>
            <ul>
                <br><li>1 cup peanut butter</li>
            </ul>
            <br><li><strong>Sugar:</strong> Sweeten things up with one cup of white sugar.</li>
            <ul>
                <br><li>1 cup white sugar</li>
            </ul>
            <br><li><strong>Egg:</strong> One egg lends moisture and helps bind the cookie dough together.</li>
            <ul>
                <br><li>1 egg</li>
            </ul>
            <br>
            <h2>Directions:</h2>
            <ol>
                <li>Preheat the oven to 350 degrees F (175 degrees C). Line baking sheets with parchment paper.</li>
                <li>Mix peanut butter, white sugar, and egg in a medium bowl until smooth.</li>
                <li>Roll mixture into 1-inch balls and place 1 inch apart on an ungreased baking sheet; flatten each with a fork, making a criss-cross pattern.</li>
                <li>Bake in the preheated oven until cookies are just barely brown on the bottoms, about 6 to 8 minutes.</li> 
                <li>Cool on the baking sheets briefly before removing to a wire rack to cool completely.</li>
            </ol>
