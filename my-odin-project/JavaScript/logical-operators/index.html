    <h1>
      This is me following along with
      <a href="https://javascript.info/logical-operators">this</a> article.
    </h1>

    <!-- There are four logical operators in JavaScript: || (OR), && (AND), ! (NOT), ?? (Nullish Coalescing). -->

    <!-- Although they are called “logical”, they can be applied to values of any type, not only boolean.  -->
    <!-- Their result can also be of any type. -->

    <!-- The “OR” operator is represented with two vertical line symbols: -->

    <!-- The logical OR is meant to manipulate boolean values only. If any of its arguments are true, it returns true, 
    otherwise it returns false. -->

    <script>
      alert(true || true); // true
      alert(false || true); // true
      alert(true || false); // true
      alert(false || false); // false
    </script>

    <!-- If an operand is not a boolean, it’s converted to a boolean for the evaluation. -->

    <script>
      if (1 || 0) {
        // works just like if( true || false )
        alert("truthy!");
      }
    </script>

    <!-- OR || is used in an if statement to test if any of the given conditions is true. -->

    <script>
      let hour = 9;

      if (hour < 10 || hour > 18) {
        alert("The office is closed.");
      }
    </script>

    <!-- more conditions -->

    <script>
      let hour2 = 12;
      let isWeekend = true;

      if (hour2 < 10 || hour2 > 18 || isWeekend) {
        alert("The office is closed."); // it is the weekend
      }
    </script>

    <!-- OR "||" finds the first truthy value -->

    <!-- The OR || operator does the following: -->

    <!-- Evaluates operands from left to right.
  For each operand, converts it to boolean. 
  If the result is true, stops and returns the original value of that operand.
  If all operands have been evaluated (i.e. all were false), returns the last operand. -->

    <!-- a chain of OR || returns the first truthy value or the last one if no truthy value is found. -->

    <script>
      alert(1 || 0); // 1 (1 is truthy)

      alert(null || 1); // 1 (1 is the first truthy value)
      alert(null || 0 || 1); // 1 (the first truthy value)

      alert(undefined || null || 0); // 0 (all falsy, returns the last value)
    </script>

    <!-- For instance, we have firstName, lastName and nickName variables, 
  all optional (i.e. can be undefined or have falsy values).

  Let’s use OR || to choose the one that has the data and show it (or "Anonymous" if nothing set) -->

    <script>
      let firstName = "";
      let lastName = "";
      let nickName = "SuperCoder";

      alert(firstName || lastName || nickName || "Anonymous"); // SuperCoder
      // If all variables were falsy, "Anonymous" would show up.
    </script>

    <!-- Short-circuit evaluation. -->

    <!-- Another feature of OR || operator is the so-called “short-circuit” evaluation.

  It means that || processes its arguments until the first truthy value is reached, and then the value is returned immediately, without even touching the other argument.
  
  The importance of this feature becomes obvious if an operand isn’t just a value, but an expression with a side effect, such as a variable assignment or a function call. -->

    <script>
      true || alert("not printed");
      false || alert("printed");
    </script>

    <!-- In the first line, the OR || operator stops the evaluation immediately upon seeing true, so the alert isn’t run.

  Sometimes, people use this feature to execute commands only if the condition on the left part is falsy. -->

    <!-- && (AND) -->

    <!-- In classical programming, AND returns true if both operands are truthy and false otherwise: -->

    <script>
      alert(true && true); // true
      alert(false && true); // false
      alert(true && false); // false
      alert(false && false); // false
    </script>

    <!-- An example with if: -->

    <script>
      let hour3 = 12;
      let minute = 30;

      if (hour3 == 12 && minute == 30) {
        alert("The time is 12:30");
      }
    </script>

    <!-- Just as with OR, any value is allowed as an operand of AND: -->

    <script>
      if (1 && 0) {
        // evaluated as true && false
        alert("won't work, because the result is falsy");
      }
    </script>

    <!-- AND “&&” finds the first falsy value -->

    <!-- The AND && operator does the following: -->

    <!-- Evaluates operands from left to right.
  For each operand, converts it to a boolean. If the result is false, stops and returns the original value of that operand.
  If all operands have been evaluated (i.e. all were truthy), returns the last operand.
  In other words, AND returns the first falsy value or the last value if none were found.
  
  The rules above are similar to OR. The difference is that AND returns the first falsy value while OR returns the first truthy one. -->

    <script>
      // if the first operand is truthy,
      // AND returns the second operand:
      alert(1 && 0); // 0
      alert(1 && 5); // 5

      // if the first operand is falsy,
      // AND returns it. The second operand is ignored
      alert(null && 5); // null
      alert(0 && "no matter what"); // 0
    </script>

    <!-- We can also pass several values in a row. See how the first falsy one is returned: -->

    <script>
      alert(1 && 2 && null && 3); // null
      // When all values are truthy, the last value is returned:
      alert(1 && 2 && 3); // 3, the last one
    </script>

    <!-- "!" (NOT) -->

    <!-- The boolean NOT operator is represented with an exclamation sign !. -->

    <!-- The operator accepts a single argument and does the following:

  Converts the operand to boolean type: true/false.
  Returns the inverse value. -->

    <script>
      alert(!true); // false
      alert(!0); // true
    </script>

    <!-- A double NOT !! is sometimes used for converting a value to boolean type: -->

    <script>
      alert(!!"non-empty string"); // true
      alert(!!null); // false
    </script>

    <!-- The first NOT converts the value to boolean and returns the inverse, and the second NOT inverses it again. In the end, we have a plain value-to-boolean conversion.

  There’s a little more verbose way to do the same thing – a built-in Boolean function: -->

    <script>
      alert(Boolean("non-empty string")); // true
      alert(Boolean(null)); // false
    </script>

    <!-- Tasks -->

    <script>
      alert(null || 2 || undefined); // 2
      alert(alert(1) || 2 || alert(3)); // first 1, then 2
      alert(1 && null && 2); // null, because it’s the first falsy value from the list.
      alert(alert(1) && alert(2)); // 1, and then undefined
      alert(null || (2 && 3) || 4); // 3
    </script>
