    </script>

    <!-- These lines don't work because any text without quotes around it is assumed to be a variable name, property name, a reserved word, or similar. If the browser can't find it, then an error is raised (e.g. "missing; before statement"). 
        <script>
      const badString1 = This is a test;
      const badString2 = 'This is a test;
      const badString3 = This is a test';
    </script> -->

    <!-- The following will work if you previously defined the variable -->
    <script>
      const badString = string;
      console.log(badString);
      //   badString is now set to have the same value as string.
    </script>

    <!-- In JavaScript, you can choose single quotes or double quotes to wrap your strings in. Both of the following will work okay: -->
    <script>
      const sgl = "Single quotes.";
      const dbl = "Double quotes";
      console.log(sgl);
      console.log(dbl);
    </script>

    <!-- Choose one and stick to it, however; differently quoted code can be confusing, especially if you use two different quotes on the same string! -->

    <script>
      // The following will return an error
          const badQuotes = 'What on earth?";
          console.log(badQuotes)
    </script>
    <script>
      const sglDbl = 'Would you eat a "fish supper"?';
      const dblSgl = "I'm feeling blue.";
      console.log(sglDbl);
      console.log(dblSgl);
    </script>
    <script>
      // you can't include the same quote mark inside the string if it's being used to contain them.
      // The following will error, as it confuses the browser as to where the string ends.
        const bigmouth = 'I've got no right to take my place…';
        console.log(bigmouth)
    </script>

    <!-- To fix our previous problem code line, we need to escape the problem quote mark. -->

    <!-- Escaping characters means that we do something to them to make sure they are recognized as text, 
        not part of the code. In JavaScript, we do this by putting a backslash just before the character. -->

    <script>
      const bigmouth = "I've got no right to take my place…";
      console.log(bigmouth);
    </script>

    <!-- Concatenating strings -->
    <!-- Concatenate just means "join together". 
    To join together strings in JavaScript you can use a different type of string, 
    called a template literal. -->

    <!-- A template literal looks just like a normal string, 
        but instead of using single or double quote marks (' or "), 
        you use backtick characters (`): -->

    <script>
      const greeting = `Hello`;
      console.log(greeting);
    </script>

    <!-- This can work just like a normal string, except you can include variables in it, 
    wrapped inside ${ } characters, and the variable's value will be inserted into the result -->

    <script>
      const name = "Eric";
      const greetingFull = `Hello, ${name}`;
      console.log(greetingFull);
    </script>

    <!-- You can use the same technique to join together two variables: -->

    <script>
      const one = "Hello ";
      const two = ", how are you?";
      const joined = `${one}${name}${two}`;
      console.log(joined);
    </script>

    <!-- Let's have a look at concatenation being used in action: -->

    <button>Press me</button>

    <script>
      const button = document.querySelector("button");

      function greet() {
        const name = prompt("What is your name?");
        alert(`Hello ${name}, nice to see you!`);
      }

      button.addEventListener("click", greet);
    </script>

    <!-- Here we're using the window.prompt() function, 
    which asks the user to answer a question via a popup dialog box 
    then stores the text they enter inside a given variable — in this case name. 
    We then use the window.alert() function to display another popup containing a 
    string which inserts the name into a generic greeting message. -->

    <!-- You can also concatenate strings using the + operator -->

    <script>
      const greetingEnd = "I hope you have a great rest of your day!";
      console.log(joined + " " + greetingEnd);
    </script>

    <!-- Numbers vs. strings -->
    <!-- So what happens when we try to combine a string and a number? Let's try it in our console -->

    <script>
      const front = "Front ";
      const number = 242;
      console.log(`${front}${number}`); // "Front 242"
    </script>

    <!-- the browser converts the number to a string and concatenates the two strings. -->

    <!-- The Number() function converts anything passed to it into a number, if it can. -->

    <script>
      const myString = "123";
      const myNum = Number(myString);
      console.log(typeof myNum);
    </script>

    <!-- every number has a method called toString() that converts it to the equivalent string. -->

    <script>
      const myNum2 = 123;
      const myString2 = myNum2.toString();
      console.log(typeof myString2);
    </script>

    <!-- For example, if a user enters a number into a form's text field, it's a string. 
    However, if you want to add this number to something, you'll need it to be a number, 
    so you could pass it through Number() to handle this. -->

    <!-- You can include JavaScript expressions in template literals, as well as simple variables, 
        and the results will be included in the result -->

    <script>
      const song = "Fight the Youth";
      const score = 9;
      const highestScore = 10;
      const output = `I like the song ${song}. I gave it a score of ${
        (score / highestScore) * 100
      }%.`;
      console.log(output);
    </script>

    <!-- Multiline strings -->
    <!-- Template literals respect the line breaks in the source code, so you can write strings that span multiple lines like this -->

    <script>
      const output2 = `I like the song.
I gave it a score of 90%.`;
      console.log(output2);

      /*
I like the song.
I gave it a score of 90%.
*/
    </script>

    <!-- To have the equivalent output using a normal string you'd have to include line break characters (\n) in the string -->

    <script>
      const output3 = "I like the song.\nI gave it a score of 90%.";
      console.log(output3);

      /*
I like the song.
I gave it a score of 90%.
*/
    </script>
