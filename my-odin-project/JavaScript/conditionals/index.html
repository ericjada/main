    <!-- Basic if...else syntax -->

    <!-- <script>
      if (condition) {
        /* code to run if condition is true */
      } else {
        /* run some other code instead */
      }
    </script> -->

    <!-- To understand this syntax better, let's consider a real example. 
    Imagine a child being asked for help with a chore by their mother 
    or father. The parent might say "Hey sweetheart! If you help me by 
    going and doing the shopping, I'll give you some extra allowance 
    so you can afford that toy you wanted." In JavaScript, we could 
    represent this like so:
 -->

    <script>
      let shoppingDone = false;
      let childsAllowance;

      if (shoppingDone === true) {
        childsAllowance = 10;
      } else {
        childsAllowance = 5;
      }
    </script>

    <!-- check out the following more involved example, which could be part of a simple weather forecast application: -->

    <label for="weather">Select the weather type today: </label>
    <select id="weather">
      <option value="">--Make a choice--</option>
      <option value="sunny">Sunny</option>
      <option value="rainy">Rainy</option>
      <option value="snowing">Snowing</option>
      <option value="overcast">Overcast</option>
    </select>

    <!-- Here we've got an HTML <select> element allowing us to make different weather choices, and a simple paragraph.
        In the JavaScript, we are storing a reference to both the <select> and <p> elements, and adding an event 
            listener to the <select> element so that when its value is changed, the setWeather() function is run.
        When this function is run, we first set a variable called choice to the current value selected in the <select> element. 
            We then use a conditional statement to show different text inside the paragraph depending on what the 
            value of choice is. Notice how all the conditions are tested in else if () { } blocks, except for the first one, 
            which is tested in an if () { } block.
        The very last choice, inside the else { } block, is basically a "last resort" option â€” the code inside it will 
        be run if none of the conditions are true. In this case, it serves to empty the text out of the paragraph if 
        nothing is selected, for example, if a user decides to re-select the "--Make a choice--" placeholder option 
        shown at the beginning. -->
